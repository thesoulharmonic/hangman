# Richard Williams - Hangman
A hangman game built using ReactJS, Typescript and Vite.

## Getting Started
To start using this project, you will need to have Node.js installed on your computer.

Start by installing Vite using npm. Vite is a development server that is more lightweight than other options like Webpack. More information about Vite can be found at https://vitejs.dev/.

`npm create vite`

Next, navigate into the project directory and install the necessary dependencies.

`cd hangman-react`
`npm install`

Start the development server by running the following command.

`npm run dev`

This will start the dev server and open the game in your default browser.

## How to Play
The game of hangman is a word guessing game where the player attempts to guess a word, one letter at a time. The player starts with a blank word, and for each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman's body will be drawn. The game is over when the player has made too many incorrect guesses or has successfully guessed the word.
